					<p>Hello! I'm Kyle Hanselman, a senior game designer and gaming enthusiast.
					Thanks to Source Engine modding, my primary background is in level design and environment art.
					However, as my career has evolved, I have found myself taking more and more steps into the technical side as a game designer.
					At this point in my career, I've spent a majority of my professional life buried in design documents and spreadsheets and I couldn't be happier.
					I have been a designer on half a dozen projects, three of which have shipped, and hope to be a designer on dozens more.
					The ultimate goal? Creative director.</p>
					<p>***</p>
					<p>My gaming journey began in 2008 when i first gained access to countless games via Steam.
					This passion grew when I began making HL2 mods on ModDB.com in 2009, and I quickly established myself in that community. 
					Wanting to improve my understanding of game design, I attended SCAD's Game Development program in 2016. 
					SCAD gave me an academic understanding of design which accompanied years of practical knowledge resulting in a BFA.
					From there, I spent some time in QA (who hasn't) and then moved into my professional design career in 2021 with Puny Human; the rest is history, as they say.
					I still have a long way to go in becoming the best game developer out there, and I'm always excited to improve and move forward.</p>

				<p class="caption-text">Sewers was the second map in a solo mod project I called 'The Canals.' This level focused on being less action focused than my previous levels and is more about atmosphere. I also really wanted to push the 'double-back' concept with players repeatedly returning to previous spaces to create a sense of space.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">This level suffers from being punishingly dark. While I wanted the atmosphere the darkness often hides a lot of environmental storytelling and makes certain sequences frustrating.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">Overall, though, I'm very happy with this level and believe it is some of my best work. I think the way events unfold - with many solutions to problems introducing new problems - keeps the level feeling fresh and exciting and, when it's not too dark, it's one of the prettier levels I've made.</p>

			</div>
				<p class="caption-text">Canal was the starting map in a solo mod project I called 'The Canals.' Unfortunately, this project was canned when I began studying at SCAD. This level focused on traversal and puzzle solving; as the first level in the mod, I wanted to avoid intense combat.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">As typical for my earlier environments, this level suffers from being frequently too dark. Watching this now, it's also apparent to me that many of my puzzle are rather obtuse and I do a poor job of leading players towards progress throughout the level.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">Similar to Sewers above, this level represents the height of my Source capabilities with advanced scripting throughout and the best visual fidelity you can strangle out of a, at the time, nearly fifteen-year-old engine.</p>

I sought to recreate a hallway from an on Iron Horizon level as a means to judge how far I've come with Source. I used similar textures and overall geometry to evoke the same space, then put a lot of effort into details, lighting, and atmosphere. The reference image can be seen at the end of this gallery.</p>

			<p class="caption-text">This level in particular was pivotal in my level design career. When I completed this map, I realized that I was capable of making levels much more beautiful and detailed than I thought. However, that beauty highlighted a serious lack of gameplay and, even worse, logical level flow.</p>

            <p class="caption-text">This level began as a standalone practice map to keep my skill sharp between projects. Ultimately, I was so happy with this map that it inspired me to begin my solo mod project 'The Canals.'</p>
			<p class="caption-text">Water Plant is a signature of this era of my work for better or worse. On the positive side, my signiture style begins to develop here - deep atmosphere, gameplay variety, verticality, and 'double-backing' layouts. On the negative, the environments are too dark and the way forward is often unintuitive to players. A unique issue to this level is an almost dreamlike layout, where the way the environments are connected is completely illogical and strange.</p>

            <p class="caption-text">Complex was the original 'Hospital Shootout' in that i's a level created purely to showcase gameplay. At the time, I was doing a lot of work to better understand AI and constructing combat encounters to add to me, at the time, generally puzzle-focused levels.</p>
			<p class="caption-text">This level suffered from a rookie mistake - while ambushes can be fun occasionally, consistent ambushes make the experience frustrating and almost force multiple playthroughs to overcome the disadvantage, which is not ideal.</p>
			<p class="caption-text">This is also one of the first levels I built that had true 'downtime.' Previous levels had some type of gameplay in every single space, making the pacing feel sluggish or annoying. You can see that in later levels, there is generally liminal spaces between setpieces.</p>

However, as evidenced by the levels above, I had a long way to go before reaching my 'peak' in terms of Source visual fidelity.</p>

			<p class="caption-text">That said, it suffered from the same primary issue many of my maps in this era did - nonsensical rooms leading to a directionless player. While, at this time, I was beginning to graps the engine, I still didn't quite understand levels beyond cool-looking rooms with some enemies or puzzles in them.</p>
			<p class="caption-text">Comparing Mines to the levels I was building just ealier that year shows pretty astounding progress.</p>

At the time, I don't think I had the understanding and skill with Source bsps to craft such a complex structure. I also was unsure how to make a level without simple hallways and rooms, so the layout itself was effectively a swerving maze of rocks most players got lost in.</p>

				<p class="caption-text">4) Reception – Foreshadows parking lot and some zombies.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">8) Back alley - First combine ambush.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">13) Emergency exit staircase - Players can use this to get between hospital and parking lot later.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">23) Hospital hall – Overlooks area 19. Pacing break.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">33) Puzzle room - Allows player to enter area 35.</p>

					<div class="slide-caption">When using Source's brush tools, I prefer to connect geo only by the corners as it keeps the orthographic views clean and easy to read. I switch to flat colors in the viewport to save my eyes.</div>

				<div class="mySlides gallery-pass1-slide"><img src="img/hlst/NodrawPass_02.PNG" alt="A Screenshot of Source Hammer Editor displaying a narrow alley made of basic geometry">
					<div class="slide-caption">One of the first differences from my sketch is that this hallway is significantly longer. This give players more time to adjust before entering high intensity spaces.</div>
					</div>
				<div class="mySlides gallery-pass1-slide"><img src="img/hlst/NodrawPass_03.PNG" alt="A Screenshot of Source Hammer Editor displaying a series of interior rooms">
					<div class="slide-caption">Lengthening the hallways required I made adjustments to the stairwell for rooms 5 and 6, but the compromise was worth improved pacing.</div>

				<div class="mySlides gallery-pass1-slide"><img src="img/hlst/NodrawPass_04.PNG" alt="A Screenshot of Source Hammer Editor displaying an open back alleyway used for utilities">

				<p class="caption-text">I begin building the rough geometry with the nodraw material which doesn't render in Source. By doing this, I won’t have to go back later and add nodraw to faces the player can’t see and I simply texture what they can; nodraw is the first step in ensuring an optimized map.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">I build basic geo at a grid scale of 16 units. This lets me keep clean geometry and prevents any leaks - I find leaks occur more often when building at smaller grid sizes. A larger grid scale would cost me flexibility of the brush tool, and it would be hard to create basic geometry at the correct scale for the player.</p>

					<div class="slide-caption">Triggers are placed for gameplay events and some props and geometry are added to help give a sense of scale; this also distiguishes locations, making navigation easier.</div>

				<div class="mySlides gallery-pass2-slide"><img src="img/hlst/GameplayPass_04.PNG" alt="A Screenshot of Source Hammer Editor displaying a storage room with narrow windows for light near the top">

				<p class="caption-text">The second pass has three goals. 1) Apply a development material to all surfaces so the map is legible. 2) Tighten up geometry with more detail to sell the setting. 3) Add the gameplay elements required for traversal such as elevators, door triggers, and breakable environment pieces.</p>

				<p class="caption-text">With this pass complete, the level should be ready for a first playthough. During this playthrough, I encountered a few bugs and gameplay issues.

				<p class="caption-text">The goal of my third pass is to get AI in place. Since I already planned this in the sketch, it's a simple matter of implementation, testing, and adjusting the balance until the combat felt right.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">With all of the AI in place, I'm ready to run another playtest.</p>

			</div>
				<p class="caption-text">This playtest presented a lot of issues, which is pretty common for a first pass of AI. I noted each one and ensured I was able to get a smooth experience before handing it to playtesters. No sense in having people playtest content I know is broken.</p>

			</div>
				<p class="caption-text">Once I was happy with where combat was and I had a complete experience, I handed this level to several players, none of which were familiar with the level or even Half-Life 2 or Source mods. I compiled a wide range of notes and feedback which I addressed in subsequent iterations. I continued testing between myself and others until the level was polished and had no consistent issues.</p>
				<p class="caption-text">Generally, at this point, I would shift gears to environment art and continue to work on the level until it's ready to ship. In this case, however, I wanted to demonstrate pure design, so I considered the level complete.</p>
